1. **16-20 industries** most relevant to this user's sales targets. Include DIVERSE industries — not just obvious ones. Cover at least 8 different sectors. Include health scores (0-100), trend direction, and top market signals for each.

2. **25-35 market signals** across these industries. Signal types: political, regulatory, economic, hiring, tech, supply_chain, social, competitive, environmental.
   Each signal needs a clear sales implication. Use recent dates near ${today}. Include REAL publication sources with realistic URLs.
   For each signal, include 2-3 "impactedEntities" with name, type (industry/company), impact (positive/negative), action (engage/avoid/monitor), and reason.

3. **45-60 prospect companies** in THREE BATCHES and FOUR REVENUE TIERS:

   REVENUE TIERS — Every batch MUST include companies across these tiers:
   🔹 TIER A — Growth Stage ($5M–$50M revenue, 20-200 employees): Fast-growing startups, emerging brands, series A-C companies. ~15% of prospects.
   🔹 TIER B — Mid-Market ($50M–$500M revenue, 200-2000 employees): Regional leaders, challenger brands, category specialists, PE-backed companies. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TIER. ~40% of prospects.
   🔹 TIER C — Upper Mid-Market ($500M–$5B revenue, 2000-20000 employees): National brands, established industry players, division-level opportunities at larger companies. ~30% of prospects.
   🔹 TIER D — Enterprise ($5B+ revenue, 20000+ employees): Fortune 500, global brands. ~15% of prospects.

   CRITICAL: The user is a digital agency — they need REACHABLE companies, not just aspirational mega-brands. Mid-market companies ($50M-$500M) are their SWEET SPOT. Think: regional restaurant chains (not McDonald's), growing DTC brands (not P&G), mid-size manufacturers (not Boeing), regional healthcare systems (not Kaiser), craft beverage companies, regional bank chains, specialty retailers, etc.

   **BATCH A — LOCAL (15-20 prospects, scope: "local"):**
   Companies near ${location_city || "the user's city"}, ${location_state || "the user's state"} (within ~150 miles).
   Include: regional employers, fast-growing startups, mid-market companies, and local operations of national brands.
   MUST include at least 5 companies under $500M revenue.
   
   **BATCH B — NATIONAL (18-25 prospects, scope: "national"):**
   Companies in OTHER US states far from ${location_state || "GA"}.
   Spread across at least 8 different states and 10+ different industries.
   MUST include at least 8 companies under $500M revenue. Include regional champions, category leaders, and rising brands — not just household names.
   
   **BATCH C — INTERNATIONAL (12-15 prospects, scope: "international"):**
   Companies in OTHER COUNTRIES (UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, Singapore, France, Brazil, India, etc.).
   Cover at least 5 different countries and diverse industries.
   Include emerging international brands and regional leaders, not just global multinationals.

   EXAMPLE MID-MARKET COMPANIES (the KIND of companies to generate — do NOT use these exact names, find REAL ones):
   - A $200M regional hospital system investing in patient engagement tech
   - A $80M craft beverage company expanding distribution nationally
   - A $150M commercial construction firm modernizing project management
   - A $300M regional grocery chain with 45 locations adopting loyalty tech
   - A $120M specialty chemical manufacturer entering new markets
   - A $60M DTC fitness brand scaling their ecommerce platform
   - A $400M regional bank modernizing their digital experience

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Each prospect's "industryId" MUST match an industry you generated. An airline is NOT "Education". Match the prospect's ACTUAL business to the correct industry.
    - REQUIRED REVENUE MIX: At least 40% of all prospects MUST have revenue under $500M. Do NOT fill the list with billion-dollar mega-brands.
    - Think about REAL, SPECIFIC companies — use actual company names the user could verify. Not generic placeholders.
    - REQUIRED: Include companies from food & beverage (QSR, CPG, craft brands), manufacturing (controls, automation), media (production studios, streaming), retail (DTC, marketplaces), and healthcare — not just tech!
    - If the user provided SERVICES, match recommendedServices to what they actually offer
    - If the user provided VALUE PROPOSITIONS, weave them into the outreachPlaybook and clientIntelligence
    - If the user provided KNOWN COMPETITORS, reference them in the competitors array with specific strength/weakness comparisons
    - If the user provided CASE STUDY INDUSTRIES, weight more prospects toward those industries
    - Each with a "Why Now" reason, key contacts, 2-3 recommended services, websiteUrl, 2-3 relatedLinks, and 3-4 competitors with strength/weakness/userAdvantage

    DECISION MAKER RULES (CRITICAL):
    - For each prospect, include 3-5 key contacts who would be relevant to the opportunity
    - ONLY use names of real, publicly verifiable executives (C-suite, SVPs, VPs) you are CONFIDENT exist at this company from public knowledge
    - If you are NOT confident a specific person holds a role, set name to the functional title (e.g. "Chief Digital Officer") and set verified to false
    - For verified contacts, set verified to true and include a source (e.g. "Company leadership page", "SEC filing", "Press release", "Public knowledge")
    - For linkedinUrl: generate a LinkedIn SEARCH URL like "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=Chief%20Digital%20Officer%20CompanyName" — NEVER use "#" or fake profile URLs
    - Include a brief "relevance" explaining why this person matters for the specific opportunity
    - Prioritize roles that align with the user's services and the prospect's "Why Now" trigger

FOR EVERY SINGLE PROSPECT you MUST also generate these fields (NOT optional):

A) "companyOverview" — 2-3 sentence description of the company, what they do, and their market position
B) "marketPosition" — One of: "Market Leader", "Strong Challenger", "Niche Specialist", "Emerging Player", "Regional Leader"
C) "competitiveAdvantage" — One sentence on their competitive moat or differentiator
D) "competitors" — Array of 3-4 competitors with: name, description, strength (their advantage), weakness (where they fall short), userAdvantage (how the user selling to this prospect beats this competitor)
E) "aiReadiness" — Object with:
   - score (0-100): How ready this company is for AI adoption based on size, industry, and tech signals
   - currentAiUsage (2-3 items): AI tools/platforms they likely already use
   - aiOpportunities (2-3 items): Where AI could specifically help THIS company
   - aiThreats (1-2 items): Where AI threatens their business model
   - humanEdge (2-3 items): What humans do better at THIS specific company
F) "companySignals" — Array of 3-6 signals SPECIFIC to this company. NEVER empty. Types: opportunity, risk, trend, milestone, competitive, regulatory. Each must have:
   - id, type, title, summary, sentiment, severity (1-5)
   - actionRequired: What the user should DO about this signal
   - source: Publication name (realistic)
   - sourceUrl: Realistic URL
   - publishedDate: Recent date near ${today}
   - relevanceToUser: How this affects the user's pitch to this prospect
G) "outreachPlaybook" — Object with:
   - primaryAngle: The ONE compelling reason to reach out NOW
   - talkingPoints: 3-5 specific talking points for a first conversation
   - objections: 2-3 objects each with "objection" and "rebuttal"
   - competitorWeaknesses: 2-3 things competitors can't do that the user can
   - idealTiming: When and why NOW is the right time
H) "clientIntelligence" — Intelligence the user can SHARE with the prospect to demonstrate deep market knowledge:
   - industryOutlook: 2-3 sentences on industry trajectory
   - keyTrends: 3-5 specific trends affecting their business
   - regulatoryWatch: 2-3 upcoming regulations or compliance items
   - aiTransformationMap: 2-3 sentences on how AI is reshaping their industry
   - recommendedActions: 3-5 things the prospect should consider doing (framed to align with user's services)

CRITICAL: companySignals must NEVER be empty. Every company has news, trends, or events. Generate specific plausible signals for each. Always include at least 1 "opportunity" type and 1 "risk" or "trend" type.

Make everything specific to the user's business capabilities and geography.`;
